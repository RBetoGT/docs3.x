# My device can only be connected through Ethernet cable. Can I use this router to connect my device to a wireless network?

Yes.

Please connect your device to the LAN port of the router and then set up [repeater](repeater.md).

Note:

* For Microuter(GL-USB150), if your device has USB port, connect Microuter to it and check if Microuter can create a USB to Ethernet connection. Then set up repeater.
* For GL-AR300M-Lite, since it has only one WAN port, you can only do that after you have connected to it wirelessly and changed its WAN port to LAN port.
* For Brume(GL-MV1000), since it doesn't has Wi-Fi module, so it need a compatible Wi-Fi dongle.
