# Can I connect to an existing Wi-Fi network (i.e. public Wi-Fi or hotel Wi-Fi) and then create my own Wi-Fi network?

Yes. GL.iNet routers will boardcast their own Wi-Fi network by default. Once you have connected to the router, you can connect it to an existing Wi-Fi network by [repeater](repeater.md).
