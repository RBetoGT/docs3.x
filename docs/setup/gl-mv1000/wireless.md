# WIRELESS

## Wireless

By default, GL-MV1000 doesn't have `WIRELESS` on the left side of web Admin Panel.

Starting from firmware version 3.100, users could add Wi-Fi to GL-MV1000 by plug a Wi-Fi dongle.

Here is a list of supported dongles that we had tested before. 

| Driver                                 | Dongle        | Tested |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| RTL8811AU/RTL8821AU                    | AWUS036ACS    | Yes    |
| RTL8812AU                              | AWUS036AC     | Yes    |

When you insert the dongle, you will see the dongle under "WIRELESS". And also you could set up as Access Point or repeater.

Click `Modify` to change the settings of the wireless network.

Click `Channel Optimization` will automatically select the most suitable channel according to the current environment.
