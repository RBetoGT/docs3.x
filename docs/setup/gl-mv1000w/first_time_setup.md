Certain Windows systems don't recognize the Brume-W as a network device or fail to find the correct driver.
Use this driver for such cases: <a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/3/setup/gl-mv1000/first_time_setup/mod-duo-rndis.zip" target="_blank">mod-duo-rndis.zip</a>

Below follows a tutorial on how to install it.
If your system reports the driver as missing, make windows look for drivers and skip to step 4).

1. Press the windows key and 'R' at the same time to get the 'Run' dialog. Type "devmgmt.msc" and press enter. (This will open the Device Manager)
